      "Adds six model-free Direct Coding Worker lifecycle actions and optional worker targeting across direct file, workspace-intelligence, Git, test, and command tools.",
      "Adds one structured cptr_fdx_intelligence action as the preferred first repository-intelligence entry point, with native FDX protocol negotiation, persistent daemon reuse, worker-aware worktree binding, bounded/redacted output, and normal CPTR fallback semantics.",
      "Runs worker commands without raw live-terminal binding; lightweight worker activity remains visible while terminal tails are loaded only on demand.",
      "Adds a single Workbench worker dashboard with compact lanes and Activity, Changes, and Terminal detail tabs.",
      "Preserves durable owner-scoped Workbench Session lifecycle, target binding, bounded event replay, static workspace inspection, project/test discovery, release readiness, and fixed-profile local test execution.",
      "Makes ChatGPT Direct Coding the default tool group and blocks CPTR/model/profile delegation unless the prompt session is explicitly authorized with allow:delegate.",
      "Adds workspace/model caching, task and monitor recovery lists, task events, batched file reads, atomic multi-edits, SHA-256 preconditions, bounded diffs, and typed error envelopes.",
      "Uses authenticated SSE as the primary delegated-task terminal detector and exposes bounded review, command tail, timeout, truncation, idempotency, and quiescence state.",
